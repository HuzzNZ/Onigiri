# Onigiri Bot Documentation

Documentation page for the Onigiri Bot on discord.

Developed by **@Huzz#0009**. ****You can find me on twitter [@HuzzuDesu](https://twitter.com/HuzzuDesu)! 

# First-time setup


### [Invite the bot!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=993098446187794462&permissions=8590198784&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

For first-time setup, run [/setup](https://www.notion.so/setup-a0ad166ca530437d8f1c19a79420a77f) to initialize the bot in the server. Youâ€™ll need to pick the channel the bot sends the schedule message in, as well setting an optional name for the talent the schedule is for.

# Functionality


The bot will send, and edit a message in a specified channel to be used as a schedule. The events are all user-inputted, and the bot only provides a framework to allow multiple users to contribute to a community-ran schedule of their favorite VTubers. By associating an event with an URL to a YouTube stream/premiere, the bot can automatically fill the details to that event from the URL!

Future updates also plan to enable the bot to create **Discord Events** based on events inputted into the bot.

# Commands


All commands have an **ephemeral** response. This means that only you can see the botâ€™s responses to your commands, so feel free to execute the commands in any channel.


ðŸ’¡ Commands with the `Manage Messages` permission can be executed by users who can manage messages in the **channel the schedule is hosted in**.


## Maintenance / Utility commands

All commands under the category of Maintenance and Utility.

## Event Creation commands

All commands under the category of Event Creation. **All events will be associated with a 4-digit numerical ID** (e.g. `1157`) to be referenced using Event Modification commands.

## Event Modification commands

All commands under the category of Event Modification. Every command requires the **ID** of an event as a parameter. This is the **4-digit numerical ID** (e.g. `1157`) assigned to events when they were created.

# Date/Time input formats


## Dates

Inputting dates is easy. The date parser accepts a wide range of date formats, and is not case sensitive: (Dates formatted like **22/07/12** should follow **y/m/d**.)

- July 12
- Jul 12 2022
- 12 Jul
- 7/12
- October 13, 2022

- 07/12
- 22/07/12
- 2022/7/12
- today
- tomorrow


ðŸ’¡ If there is no year specified, any date with the month **before** the current month will automatically be assumed to be in the **next year**. For example, if today is **December 12, 2022**, then inputting **Jan 4** will lead to it being recorded as **Jan 4, 2023**. You can override this by specifying the year.


ðŸ’¡ You can type **today** or **tomorrow** as a shorthand for the respective days. The bot will determine this based on JST, so **check if the time has passed midnight JST before using this shorthand**.


## Times

Inputting time is also easy, and not case sensitive. See the reference below: (**hh:mm** should be followed. **Do not specify seconds!**)

- 20:00
- 20
- 2000
- 25:15
- 24

- 8pm
- 8:00 pm
- 8PM
- 1:15am
- now


ðŸ’¡ You can type **now** as a shorthand for the current minute. Events with time set to the current minute will appear as a **Past Event**.


ðŸ’¡ Hours **beyond 23** are supported, as it is quite commonly used in Japan. Anything representing **24:00** until **29:59** will be recognized, and recorded as **0:00** until **5:59** the next day.

# YouTube Link Data Extraction


This bot uses Googleâ€™s **[YouTube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)** to extract information for use. Because of the limitations of this API, it is currently impossible to distinguish a **finished livestream** from a **premiered video**. As such, all finished livestreams or premiered videos that are longer than **15 minutes** will be considered a `stream` type, and anything under will be considered a `video`. You can use **/type** to edit this if it is inaccurate.
